# skateLocate

A single page application to find skateparks near you via search, tags, recently added, and most voted. 

End-users can upload new parks to the map, add images, and vote.

The core is built with the MEAN stack (Angular 1), and Mapbox/Leaflet for the mapping, images are uploaded with Cloudinary, and finally packaged with JSPM to allow ES6 to be used now.
