		<h3>Howdy</h3>

		<p>Thanks for trying out skateLocate - Made for skaters to help locate locate spots easily.</p> 
		<p>When I came to London I had no idea there were so many, so thought it would be good to document them.</p> 
		<p>If you've got a spot to share, click 'add' in the top left and left click (or tap if you're on a mobile) on the location to begin adding. You'll need to add in your name and the park name. But if you wanna write a short description or have an image then please do add it too!</p>
		<p>Hoping on getting an offline mode developed, so when you're on your way out skating and wanna check quickly you can do!</p>

		<p>Built by Ben Smith @ <a href="http://intheon.uk" target="_blank">intheon.uk</a> - Give me a shout if you've any feedback! Thanks!</p>
